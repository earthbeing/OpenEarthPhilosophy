In the age of information, it is essential for a religion to be easily accessible by individuals from various backgrounds and beliefs. By being open-source, our religion promotes inclusivity and welcomes people from different walks of life. This inclusivity fosters unity and cooperation among humans, essential qualities for addressing the challenges of the modern world.

The modern world presents both challenges and opportunities, and our religion recognizes the need for humans to explore the universe and become multi-planetary. With the increasing possibilities of space exploration, our religion encourages individuals to embrace the opportunity of interplanetary settlement. By doing so, humans can transcend their current limitations and evolve into responsible members of the intergalactic community.

In order to be relevant, our religion also acknowledges the importance of staying in harmony with other species within the intergalactic community. We promote the teachings of peaceful coexistence, respect for the beliefs of others, and non-violence. These principles foster understanding and cooperation, enabling humanity to build positive relationships with other species and contribute to a harmonious intergalactic community.

Furthermore, our religion emphasizes the need for continuous adaptation and evolution to meet the changing needs of humanity and the intergalactic community. As societal, technological, and scientific advancements occur at an unprecedented pace, individuals and communities must adapt their beliefs and practices accordingly. Our religion encourages its followers to embrace change and remain open to new ideas and perspectives, empowering them to address the challenges of the modern world effectively.

In conclusion, Chapter 8 of our open-source bible highlights the relevance of our religion's principles and teachings to the modern world.
