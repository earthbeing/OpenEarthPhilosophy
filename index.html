    # New Earth Philosophy

Welcome to the New Earth Philosophy repository. This open-source movement is based on modern laws of physics, simulation theory, and multiverse realities, aiming to develop an understanding of how humans can transcend their intelligence to join the universal collective intelligence.

## Overview

It promotes unity, cooperation, and exploration while being rooted in scientific principles, inclusivity, and tolerance.
